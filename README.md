### AI · Data · Governance

Structuring problems clearly  
and using AI as infrastructure for better decisions

## About

I work at the intersection of **AI, data, and governance**,  
with a focus on **problem structuring, knowledge organization, and decision support**.

My background combines accounting, public data consulting, and AI system design.  
Rather than building models for their own sake,  
I design **systems that make complex information usable, traceable, and reusable**.

---

## Focus Areas

- AI Governance & Data Strategy  
- Public Data & AI Platforms  
- Digital Audit & Risk Analytics  
- SDG-oriented data and policy analysis  

---

## AI Focus

- Ontology-based RAG for structured knowledge retrieval and traceability  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for data-driven decision support  
- LLM-based workflow automation using task-oriented agentic patterns  

---

## Technical Focus

- Python & SQL for lightweight data analysis and automation  
- AI-assisted development for rapid prototyping  
- Workflow orchestration using tools such as n8n  
- Experimentation with MCP-based tool and agent integration  

I focus less on low-level implementation and more on  
**connecting tools, structuring workflows, and making AI systems usable**.
